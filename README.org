* Think about the problem 
- What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
- Is the problem well defined?
- How can you evaluate the outcome of the project? 
- Is machine learning the best solution? 
  - Acess to a sizable set of data
  - Each additional feature requires addtional samples to train model properly  
  - There is no better alternatives

* Measure model success
Knowing when to stop refining the model, and put it into production. 


* Stages of Machine Learning Workflow
** Data Import 
- import csv files, load features and outcomes into dataframes 
- split features and outcomes into train and test dataset
  
** Data Exploration and Feature Engineering
- get the dimension of the data
- if data is high dimensional, use dimension reduction to visualize
- identify features in your data, which is subset of data attributes in your raw data that you use in your model
- clean the data by finding errors or anomalities 

** Data preprossing
- Normalizing numeric data into common scale
- Applying formatting rules to data
- Reducing data redundancy through simplification, eg. converting a text feature into bag of words representation
- Representing text numerically, as when assigning values to each possible value in a categorical feature
- Assigning key values to data instances

** Training Set Creation
- split the data into training and testing set  

** Machine Learning Algorithm
- Cross validation
- Parameter tuning using random search or grid search
- Select and test the models 

** Deployment
